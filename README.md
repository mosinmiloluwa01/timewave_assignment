## 7-Day Price Chart Component

### Description:
This project aims to build a UI component that displays the 7-day price chart of the **$ATOM-$NTRN pair** on the Astroport DEX that operates on the Neutron network. The component will convey information about the x-y axes, the average price over the week, and the maximum and minimum prices for the week. The min and max prices were piced from the JSON data returned.

### Assumptions:
1. **Responsive Design**: The component will be designed to be responsive, ensuring that it displays properly on various screen sizes and devices.

2. **Data Processing**: Data processing, such as converting timestamps to human-readable dates and calculating average will be handled client-side using JavaScript.

3. **Static Web Page**: The solution will be delivered as a static web page, which can be easily hosted and accessed via a web browser.

### Instructions for Running the Project:
1. Clone repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the price chart component.
